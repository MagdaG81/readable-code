## Glossary


**Argument**

A value passed to a function when it is called.

```python
def greet(name):
  print('Hello',name)
greet('Lisa') # Call the function
```

**Concern**

A concern in coding refers to a specific aspect, feature, or responsibility within a code. It represents a particular piece of functionality, requirement, or domain-specific logic that needs to be addressed in the code.

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle**

The DRY principle states that each piece of knowledge or logic should have exactly one authoritative representation within a system.

**Function**

A block of organized, reusable code that performs a single action.

```python
def greet():
  print('Hello')

greet() # Call the function
```

**Numerical Variable**

A variable that holds a number value (either whole numbers or decimals)
```python
age = 22 # integer- whole number
height = 1.65 # float- decimal 

```


**Responsibility**

A responsibility in programming is a specific task, duty, or function that a piece of code is expected to handle

**Separation of Concern**

Separation of Concerns is a fundamental principle that guides how we organize code by breaking it into distinct, independent pieces. It ensures that each component of the system handles exactly one concern, making the code more manageable and maintainable.

**String**

A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes (single or double).
```python
name = 'Lisa'
number_as_string = '6'
```

**Unit**

A single, independent piece of code that performs a specific task


**Variable**

A named container that stores a value in Python:
```python
age = 22 #create a varialbe age with value 22
```
